The entire project is covered by the GPL license which follows or any
later version of the GPL license.

Note that the project includes code from other libraries (zlib, bzip2, xz,
libtld, controlled_vars) which are governed by their own license. However,
you should get a copy of those libraries from their own source instead of
using our version in wpkg since the wpkg versions were somewhat modified
to fit the need for the wpkg.exe to be 100% a standalone software.
